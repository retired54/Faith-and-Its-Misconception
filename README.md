#  one single question that will lead us into half of the world’s topics

Faith is not a feeling or anything else. Faith is simply an understanding. You must understand, you need to understand, because everything revolves around understanding. If you understand, you will believe, and if you believe, you will avoid all your bad habits and all the evils of this world, and your soul will become pure.
And in order to understand, you still lack so, so, so, so much.
And here comes one single question that will lead us into half of the world’s topics:
***"What exactly must you understand?"***

Faith is taken in the wrong way. It is often misunderstood. Most people think that faith is a feeling, but this is a mistaken way of thinking.

First, I will ask you—and answer this within yourself: **What is one of the main reasons that contributed to the deterioration of this world, the decline of people’s minds?** Things are obvious, people see them, yet they ignore them. The truth is clear. For example, why do women paint their faces? Isn’t it obvious? Because they have created an illusion in their minds. And this illusion is nothing but imagination. They imagine. If you imagine, you live according to what you imagine. If you imagine all your life that you are the best in a certain field, then you will indeed become the best—you will, without doubt, become very skilled. But if you imagine yourself beautiful all the time, you will constantly try to live seeking to become more and more beautiful. Imagination is what creates illusions.

And there are organizations that realized this. That is why they created many things that fostered such illusions. People were forced to live in illusions in a very refined way that shows the immense capabilities of the human mind. If you think this is not planned, just look around you. Look at TikTok—do you think this is something good? It was created only for scrolling. Why, in your opinion?  **why do porno websites still exist?** **Why haven’t they been banned?** **Why are they accessible to the public?**

You must understand that there is only one God, and that is Allah, the Truth. There is nothing else.Do you think He created it to move in chaos? He created it and established a system for it, and He set rules to organize it so that there would be peace.  It is the true to investigate all religions, yep u should to do it , but you must study the religion itself—not those who claim to follow it, not those who call themselves its followers. You did not create yourself by yourself , and likewise when you die, you will not manage it yourself—because you did not create yourself by yourself . You are not in control. Therefore, you must study Islam, not Muslims. For right now, Muslims are the weakest version of themselves, even among the Arabs.

Listen to the Qur’an to feel its truthfulness, to feel the reality. After studying Islam well, and understanding it, and reflecting on your life and experiences, you will begin to believe. And after studying the Qur’an, realizing it, and understanding it, congratulations—you will begin to have faith.


**True faith will make you never fear failure, nor people, nor even jinn, nor anything else. You will remain calm and at peace throughout most of your life. People think they are free, or not free—this is a topic of great debate. But the truth is that you are free within those rules, because of the rules that God has established. Do you think God created life to run in chaos? Of course not. He created it to run in peace, and He honored mankind as the best of His creation, favored by Him. Being human, you must thank God for making you human.**

**This is the truth.**


**GOOD LUCK EVERYONE**
